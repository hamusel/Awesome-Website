# Awesome Website README

## Introduction

Welcome to the Awesome Website README! This document provides an overview of what we've learned from the website, the technologies used, and the key components that make up its structure and design.

## Technologies Used

### HTML5
The structure of the website is built using HTML5, providing a semantic and organized layout. Key elements include:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Defines the document type and version of HTML.
- `<html lang="en">`: Specifies the language of the document.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata, title, and links to stylesheets.
- `<body>`: Contains the main content of the website.

### CSS3
The visual presentation is handled by CSS3, enhancing the appearance and layout. Key features include:

- External stylesheet linked via `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`.
- Google Fonts integration for custom typography.
- Flexbox for flexible and responsive layouts.
- Media queries for responsive design adjustments.
