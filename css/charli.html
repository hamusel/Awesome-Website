            Charlotte Emma Aitchison (born 2 August 1992), known professionally as Charli XCX, is an English singer and
            songwriter. Born in Cambridge and raised in Start Hill, Essex, she began posting songs on Myspace in 2008,
            which led to her discovery by a promoter who invited her to perform at warehouse raves. In 2010, she signed
            a recording contract with Asylum Records, releasing a series of singles and mixtapes throughout 2011 and
            2012.

            In 2012, Charli XCX rose to prominence collaborating with Swedish duo Icona Pop on "I Love It", which
            became
            an international success. Her debut studio album, True Romance (2013), was released to positive
            reception
            but failed to meet commercial expectations. In 2014, she contributed the hook and bridge to "Fancy" by
            Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, which finished the year as one of the best-selling singles worldwide and
            was
            nominated for two Grammy Awards. The same year, Charli XCX released "Boom Clap", which became her first
            solo
            top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100. Her second studio album, the punk-influenced Sucker (2014) was
            released at the end of the year, and spawned the successful singles "Break the Rules" and "Doing It".

            In 2015, Charli XCX began working alongside producers associated with the UK collective PC Music,
            developing
            a more experimental sound and image. While working on her third album, she released the Vroom Vroom EP
            (2016) and the mixtapes Number 1 Angel and Pop 2 (both 2017), as well as a series of singles including
            the
            BPI-certified "After the Afterparty", "Boys", and "1999". Her third and fourth studio albums, Charli
            (2019)
            and How I'm Feeling Now (2020), received widespread acclaim. Her fifth studio album, Crash (2022),
            became
            her biggest commercial success to date. In 2023, she released the single "Speed Drive" as part of Barbie
            the
            Album, the soundtrack of Barbie. In 2024, Charli XCX released her sixth studio album Brat, to critical
            acclaim.
